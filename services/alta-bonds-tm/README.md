# ALTA Bondsâ„¢

## Financing company growth using our Web3 corporate bond program.

### What are ALTA Bonds?

ALTA Bonds are debt instruments utilized to finance company growth, capital expenditures, and technology investments in the core business, outside the scope of real-estate-specific investments.

### How does it work?

ALTA Bonds are debt instruments that the company sells to investors. Each bond is denominated in 1,000 USDC. At the end of the maturity date, the company agrees to buy back the bond from the investor at that denomination.

Each bond offering has a base currency in USDC, coupon, number of annual interest payments, and maturity date.

Up until the maturity date, bond owners can redeem interest, according to the number of annual payments on that specific bond. After the Maturity Date, a bond owner may redeem any unpaid principal and sell-back their bond at face value to the company.

To purchase, a buyer connects their Web3 wallet, gets ALTA Verified for that wallet (one time only per wallet), and then clicks the "Buy" button. A buyer may purchase one or more bonds.
